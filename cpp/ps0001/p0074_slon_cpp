155
940
168
--------
1263
1. Problem Statement:
   - You have to add the following numbers:
     ```
     155
     940
    +168
    -----
    ```
2. Step-by-Step Solution:
   - Align the numbers vertically by their least significant digits.
   - Add the digits column by column from right to left, carrying over any value more than 9.
3. Calculation:
   - Units place: \(5 + 0 + 8 = 13\) (write 3, carry over 1)
   - Tens place: \(5 + 4 + 6 + 1 = 16\) (write 6, carry over 1)
   - Hundreds place: \(1 + 9 + 1 + 1 = 12\) (write 2, carry over 1)
   - Thousands place: \(1\) (write 1)
   The result is:
   ```
   1263
   ```
So, the summation of 155, 940, and 168 is 1263
